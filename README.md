Font Awesome
============

This module allows including Font Awesome icons via CSS classes in your website.
It loads the Font Awesome CSS file via a CDN to reduce server load.

You can use Font Awesome icons in your own module/theme with the following code:

``` php
if (module_exists('font_awesome')) {
  // Add Font Awesome CSS classes to your HTML here.
  // See https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use for examples.
}
```

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- If needed, also enable the included Font Awesome Field sub-module.

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > User
  Interface > Font Awesome (admin/config/user-interface/font-awesome) to set
  the source for the Font Awesome CSS file.

Advanced Usage
--------------

On the configuration page, you can select 'Local' to define an alternative
local path for the Font Awesome CSS file. This enables you to load a custom
version of the library, such as a slimmed down version with only the icons
needed for your site.

You can also select 'Other' if the icons will be loaded via the theme or
possibly a custom module, but you still need this module to enable Font Awesome
Field, as a dependency to another module or to enable enhancements within
another module. Loading this way also enables you to customise the library.
